## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite applications:
    
    TikTok :
    - The UI is great and makes it feel easy to navigate 
    - The the update to have a livestream while doing something else for picture in picture is great 
    Twitch: 
    - The audio only feature is great when I can't look at the screen 
    - The interaction we can have with a creator is pretty awesome 
    Robinhood:
    -Easy navigation UI for beginners 
    -The dark UI is also my favorite 
    
    An application feature that I think would be nice to add to Youtube is the ability like Twitch to have audio only option.
